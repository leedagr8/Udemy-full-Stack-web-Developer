// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  

var first;
var second;

first = prompt("Please enter your first number");
second = prompt("Please enter your second number");

var sum = Number(first) + Number(second);

alert("sum of your two numbers are " + sum);

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var divide = Number(first) / Number(second);

var sub = Number(first) - Number(second);

var mult = Number(first) * Number(second);

alert("The difference of your two numbers are " + sub);

alert("the product of your two numbers are " + mult);

alert("the quotient of your two numbers are " + divide);
